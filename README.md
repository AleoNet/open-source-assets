# Mainnet Is Live! Spread The Word!

## _Wen Mainnet? Now._

We’d love for you to be a part of this special moment and help us spread the word, so we created a two asset packs that you can use right now:

## _[The Mainnet Graphics Pack](https://github.com/AleoNet/open-source-assets/tree/main/Aleo%20Mainnet%20Graphics%20Pack)_

Inside this pack are ready-to-post graphics with different kinds of messaging that you can choose from to make your own celebratory statement.

## _The Mainnet Design Pack_

With this pack, you can create your own assets with Aleo’s brand style to spread the word your own way. From Font files, to logo files,  to branded templates — it’s all here. We’re excited to see what you come up with!
